# Homework 7: async conditioner

## Overview

The purpose of this assignment was to create a conditioner for an asynchronous, bouncing signal coming from a physical pushbutton. It consists of 3 components. A synchronizer which syncronizes the input to the system clock, a debouncer which ignores bouncing in the button press and release, and a one-pulse component which creates a one clock cycle pulse on the button press. This will be used for Lab 4's inputs, as well as any other button input.
