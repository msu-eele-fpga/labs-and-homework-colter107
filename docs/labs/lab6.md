# Lab 6: Creating a Custom Component in Platform Designer

## Overview
The purpose of this lab was to create a custom component to control our hardware LED patterns. This was done using Quartus's Platform Designer. The project from lab 4 was modified to include the HPS, and a new component was created using an IP core and VHDL to control the system from software. Finally, the functionality of the hardware portion system was re-verified.

## Deliverables
### Questions 

> What hex value did you write to base_period to have a 0.125 second base period?

0000 0010b = 0x02h

> What hex value did you write to base_period to have a 0.5625 second base period? 

0000 1010b = 0x0Ah
